Hey there!

So this is my portfolio website, which consists of all my projects, some blog posts, and cool art.

This is a single page application built entirely with vanilla javascript (except a couple cool libraries, shhh).
I tried to keep the libraries to a minimum, only using what I really needed, or if I just thought it would be fun to use.
All the routing, rendering, and basic functionality of the site is all vanilla js. It may seem a little overkill to do this for just a simple portfolio website,
which I will agree with you, but I just wanted to see if I could do it :)

Doing this with vanilla js will hopefully give me a better understanding of how modern front-end frameworks work and maybe a better appreciation for what they can do.

Thanks for checking it out! calp.io
